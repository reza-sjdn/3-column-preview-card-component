## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Set a border to a button even as the same color as the button background!
  This way you control some odd behaviour when hovering.

- Check the responsibility always in a slow transition!

- `h1` is the main header and there must be just one `h1` element in the whole page.
   for this project use `h2` for headers.

### Continued development

I must go deeper in `border-radius`. I'm gonna study an article in MDN.
